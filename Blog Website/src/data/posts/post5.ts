# Introduction to API Design

A well-designed API can make or break a developer's experience when integrating with your service. This guide covers the fundamental principles of effective API design.

## What Makes a Good API?

A good API is:

- **Intuitive**: Developers can guess how to use it without extensive documentation
- **Consistent**: Follows predictable patterns and conventions
- **Well-documented**: Provides clear, comprehensive documentation
- **Versioned**: Changes don't break existing integrations
- **Secure**: Implements proper authentication and authorization
- **Performant**: Responds quickly and efficiently

## RESTful API Design Principles

### Use HTTP Methods Appropriately

- **GET**: Retrieve resources
- **POST**: Create new resources
- **PUT**: Update a resource completely
- **PATCH**: Update a resource partially
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource

### Use Nouns for Resource URLs

\`\`\`
# Good
GET /users/123

# Not as good
GET /getUser/123
\`\`\`

### Use HTTP Status Codes Correctly

- **2xx**: Success (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content)
- **3xx**: Redirection (301 Moved Permanently)
- **4xx**: Client Error (400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found)
- **5xx**: Server Error (500 Internal Server Error)

### Handle Errors Consistently

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "The request was invalid",
    "details": ["Name field is required"]
  }
}
\`\`\`

## GraphQL API Design

GraphQL offers an alternative to REST with some distinct advantages:

- Clients specify exactly what data they need
- Multiple resources in a single request
- Strong typing system
- Introspection for better tooling

Example query:

\`\`\`graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      commentCount
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## API Authentication Options

### API Keys

Simple but effective for public APIs:

\`\`\`
GET /api/resources?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
\`\`\`

### OAuth 2.0

More complex but secure for user data:

1. User authorizes your app
2. Your app receives an access token
3. Use the token for authenticated requests

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Stateless authentication with signed tokens:

\`\`\`
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
\`\`\`

## API Versioning

APIs need to evolve while maintaining compatibility. Common versioning strategies:

### URL Path Versioning

\`\`\`
https://api.example.com/v1/resources
https://api.example.com/v2/resources
\`\`\`

### Header Versioning

\`\`\`
Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json
\`\`\`

### Query Parameter Versioning

\`\`\`
https://api.example.com/resources?version=1
\`\`\`

## Documentation Best Practices

- Provide clear, concise explanations
- Include request/response examples
- Document all parameters and return values
- Keep documentation up-to-date with the API
- Consider interactive documentation (like Swagger/OpenAPI)

Remember, a well-designed API is an investment that pays off through developer satisfaction, fewer support requests, and more successful integrations.
